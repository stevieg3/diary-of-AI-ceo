<s><s> [INST] Welcome, Elon. You're a figure often described as a visionary and a maverick, reshaping industries and even our approach to space exploration. But every story has a beginning. I'm curious about the earliest influences that shaped your perspective and drive. What were the pivotal moments or experiences in your early life that set you on this path of relentless innovation and ambition? [/INST]Well, I think my parents played a lot of role in that. They all had high expectations for me. My mother, she was a teacher and she always encouraged me to ask more questions and to think about things deeply. My father, he had a lot of influence because he worked at IBM and he had access to the most advanced computers and robotics of the time. And he would bring home all these like toys, like remote-controlled cars and robots that I just thought were magical. And he encouraged me to take things apart and try to understand how they worked. So I was very curious from a very young age. And also, I think we were living in a very exciting time where there was a lot of optimism about what technology could do to improve the world.</s> [INST] You were born in South Africa, right? [/INST]Yes.</s> [INST] And I read that you moved to Canada when you were a few months old. [/INST]Yes.</s> [INST] What was the context in South Africa at the time? What was the political climate? [/INST]It was a very troubled time. It was the 70s and the 80s, and there was a lot of violence and unrest. My father was working on a software project for the South African defense department, and there was a lot of corruption and things like that. So we moved to Canada when I was a few months old to escape the chaos.</s> [INST] And your father, you said he brought home these like robots and things. What was his career? [/INST]He was a software engineer and he worked for IBM. So he was working on very large computer systems. And when I was a kid, he had access to their most advanced prototypes. So he would bring home all kinds of like robotic arms and things like that that were like the size of a small car. And I just thought it was magical. I thought, this is like science fiction. This is like the future. This is what's possible with technology.</s> [INST] And from a young age, you were very interested in computers and programming. [/INST]Yeah, I was very curious. I was always taking things apart and trying to understand how they worked. I was reading books about electronics and physics and math. And my father was very supportive. He encouraged me to pursue my interests. When I was a kid, I think I was maybe 8 years old, he got me my first computer. It was an Altair microprocessor, which was one of the first personal computers ever made. And it came with a cassette tape recorder and a bunch of 8-inch floppy disks. And I remember writing my first program, which was just printing hello world on the screen. And it took me like two weeks to figure out how to do it. But I was just so excited. I remember I was so proud of myself. I ran out into the backyard and yelled, look what I just did.</s> [INST] And then as you grew older, you were, from what I've read, a bit of a troublemaker at school. Yeah, I was, I was always getting into trouble. I was always doing things that were not sanctioned or approved. I was always tinkering with things that I shouldn't have been. I was always hacking into the school computer system. I was always trying to get into the computer room after hours and do all kinds of crazy things. [/INST]Yeah, I was always getting into trouble. I was always like, I was always pushing boundaries. I was always thinking of ways to do things that were not allowed, but were fun and exciting and kind of subversive. I guess I was a bit of a punk rocker at heart.</s> [INST] Speaking of which, I read that you were quite influenced by punk rock music. Yeah, I was always listening to punk rock. When I was a teenager, that was my favorite genre of music. I just thought that the ethos of punk rock was incredibly important. It was like, you know, this is something that is against the establishment, that is about doing it your own way, that is about rebellion. And that had a big influence on me. [/INST]Yeah, I loved punk rock. I loved bands like The Sex Pistols and The Clash. I was obsessed with punk rock. I listened to it all the time. And I think, yeah, I think it did have a big influence on me. I think the spirit of punk rock was very, very important for me and a lot of other people of my generation. It was a time when, you know, we were rebelling against a lot of the cultural norms and the political norms of the time.</s> [INST] And that led you to start a band? Yeah, I started a band with my best friend at the time, a guy called Rob. And we called the band Phantasmagoria. And I remember we were all like 16, 15. Yeah, I think we were 15. And we just wanted to have fun. We just wanted to play music. We were both obsessed with punk rock. And I think it was a great time for me. It was a great learning experience. It was a great way to learn how to write songs and play in a band.</s> [INST] And it was around that time that you also met some other people that would be pivotal in your life. I think so. Yeah, I met a lot of interesting people around that time. I met my best friend, Zachary, who's still my best friend today. I met a lot of other people in the hacker community in Vancouver, Canada, where I was living at the time. But the most important person I met around that time was probably Brian Armstrong. I think I met Brian around that time. Yeah, we were both living in Ottawa, Canada. And Brian was, he was a year or two older than me, but he was really interested in computers and cryptography. And he was one of the first people I met who was really into Bitcoin. He was obsessed with it. He was writing a paper on it. He was talking about it all the time. And I was very curious. I wanted to learn more. I wanted to understand it. And so that's how we met.

I wanted to understand the potential rewards. I was just very curious.</s> [INST] And that paper, The Nature of Money, is kind of where your thoughts on cryptocurrency start, right?

<s><s> [INST] Barack, as someone who has journeyed from the humble beginnings in Hawaii to the highest office in the land, your story is one of remarkable transformation and inspiration. I'm always fascinated by the early years that shape an individual. Could you take us back to those formative moments in your youth that set you on this incredible path, helping us understand the influences and experiences that molded you into the person you are today? [/INST]Well, I think, you know, I'm from Hawaii. And I think there's something magical about being in a place where you're near the ocean, where you can just hang out and play and be a kid. And that's kind of how I grew up. My family didn't have much money. My mother worked two jobs, my father worked two jobs. We didn't have much, but we had love. We had a great sense of community. We had the beach. We had all these parks. And I think that sense of community and love, but also just this kind of laid-back, you know, playful nature, I think really shaped who I am. And I'm grateful for it. And I'm grateful for the fact that when I went to college, I was able to go to Occidental College in Los Angeles. which is a liberal arts school, which meant I could take all these different classes and kind of figure out who I was. And I was able to do that on a Pell Grant, which is like, you know, federal financial aid. And so I was able to go to school for free. And I was able to kind of explore. And that was really important.</s> [INST] At that age, what were you interested in? What were you passionate about? [/INST]Well, I was passionate about reading. I was passionate about music. I was passionate about playing basketball. I was passionate about debate. And I was just trying to figure out what was, you know, what was interesting to me and what I wanted to do. And I also remember at the time, my mother's working two jobs, my father's working two jobs, and we don't have health insurance. And I remember at the time, I'm like 18 or 19 years old, I'm like, I need to do something that's meaningful, that's gonna impact the world. And I remember having this conversation with my friend, and we're like, what could we do? And he's like, well, you know, we could go work at a law firm. And I'm like, but what is the impact of working at a law firm? And he's like, well, you could do pro bono work. And I'm like, but what is the impact of doing pro bono work?

I went to Harvard Law School.</s> [INST] Harvard Law School. And then you ended up becoming a lawyer. [/INST]I became a lawyer. And I took a job at a law firm. But I didn't last very long at the law firm. I didn't like it. I didn't like the culture. I didn't like the fact that I was working for a big corporation and I was just doing paperwork. And I'm like, I can do better than this. I can do more than this. And I was also at the time, I was working on this idea of, you know, how do you make healthcare more accessible and affordable? And I was working on this idea of a health care savings account, which was basically a health care account that people could use to pay for health care, but it was also tax free. And I was working on this idea, and I was like, how do I build this? And I was like, I need to learn how to write code. So I took a course on HTML and I took a course on PHP. And I was like, I'm going to build this website. And I did. And I launched it. And it worked. And I was like, this is cool. This is different. This is interesting. And I was like, I need to figure out how to make this scalable. I need to figure out how to make this legal. I need to figure out how to make this sustainable.

So I had a health care plan, but I didn't have the resources, didn't have the capital to market it effectively. So I was working on this idea, but I didn't have the resources to make it really work. And so I needed a job. And so I had this idea, well, maybe I'll work in a charity shop. Like maybe I'll work at Goodwill or Plato's Closet. And I was like, I'll work at night. I'll work on my health care plan. I'll work during the day. And I did that for a couple years. And I remember like it was like a side hustle. It was like fun. It was rewarding. It was challenging.

I'm going to pursue my dream. I'm going to pursue the thing that is meaningful and important to me.

<s><s> [INST] Jeremy, welcome to the Diary of a CEO. You've become a household name through your work on 'Top Gear' and 'The Grand Tour,' captivating audiences with your unique take on the world of motoring. But I'm interested in the journey that led you here. Can you take me back to your earliest years, to the moments and influences that steered you towards this path of becoming one of the most recognized figures in the world of automotive journalism? [/INST]I was brought up in a tiny village in Hampshire. I had a father who was a school teacher, and a mother who was a house teacher. I had an older sister who went off to university, and then I was the only one left at home. I had a very, very happy childhood. My father was a great, great influence on me. He was the one who took me to my first concert when I was 10 years old. It was The Who, and I loved rock and roll music. That's where I got my love of music. He was also the one who took me to my first motor show when I was 12 years old, and I saw a Ferrari 500 Super sports. I'll never forget that day. I saw a Ferrari 500 Super sports and I thought, that's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. And I was like a scavenger. I was going around, I was trying to find out how much it cost. I was like 12 years old and I was like, I'm gonna buy that when I'm older. That was my dream. And I came back to the same spot a year later and it was still there. And I was like, I'm gonna buy that when I'm 18. And I did buy it. I bought it when I was 18. And I went off to university and I came back and I sold it. And I went to another one. And I sold it. I was like a collector of sort of sports cars. I had a Porsche, I had a Ferrari, I had a Lamborghini, I had a Ford Caprice Classic. I had these amazing cars. And I was like a petrolhead. I loved cars. I used to race them. I did all sorts of crazy things.</s> [INST] How old were you when you started to have that relationship with cars? [/INST]I was eight. I was eight years old and my father took me to a show. I was so influenced by my father. He was a great, great man. He was a rock and roll teacher. He was a great influence on me. He taught me to be individualistic. He was the one who inspired me to be a presenter. He was a huge influence on me.</s> [INST] What did you think you wanted to be when you were an adult? Like if I'd asked you when you were 16, 17, what did you envisage your career being? [/INST]Well, I had finished my A-levels. I didn't get into university because I was more interested in being a rock and roll musician. I thought, I'm gonna be a rock and roll star. I'm gonna be a musician. I wasn't really interested in going to university, but I went to a college, and then I started to get a bit better at studying, and I went back to university, but I still wasn't really interested in my studies. I was more interested in playing in a band. So I dropped out of university again, and I started a band called The Rocker, and I was a drummer, and we played rock and roll music. I had a great time. We played lots of gigs, and I was like a scavenger. I was like, where's the next pub we can play at? Where's the next pub we can play at? And we were playing in pubs, and we were playing in clubs, and we were playing in nightclubs, and it was great. And then we got a recording contract. And then we went into the studio to record an album. And then I got fired. Because they didn't like the way I played the drums. And that was it. That was the end of my rock and roll career. And I went back to university. And I was at university studying for my final exams, and I was like, what do I wanna do? I don't want to be a teacher. I don't want to be a librarian. I don't want to be a journalist. I don't want to be a lawyer. I don't want to be a doctor. I don't want to be an accountant. I don't want to be a banker. What do I wanna do? And I just thought, I just love cars. I love motor cars. I've always been obsessed by them. And I thought, I'll go and be a car journalist. And I went and got a job on a magazine called CAR, and I was a junior writer. And I started writing about cars, and I was like a scavenger again. I was like, where's the next car I can drive for a test? Where's the next car I can drive for a test? I was like a car enthusiast. I was like a car obsessed. I was like a petrolhead. I was like a maniac. I was like a nutter. I was like a fanatic. I was like a car mad. And I was like a scavenger again. I was like, where's the next car I can drive for a test? And I drove lots of cars and I wrote about them. And then I did a story on the Ford Caprice Classic. And I was like, this is the best car I've ever driven. This is the best car I've ever driven. I love this car. And I put it in a list of the top 10 best cars in the world. And the editor of the magazine at the time was Chris Harris. And he was like, do you want to come and do a segment on our new show called The Gadget Show? Do you want to come and do a piece on The Gadget Show? And I was like, what's The Gadget Show? I've never heard of it. What do you do on The Gadget Show? And he said, you just talk about gadgets. And I was like, I'll do it. I'll give it a go. So I went on The Gadget Show, and I did a segment. I did two segments. I did a segment on the PlayStation 2. I did a segment on the Samsung Droid. And I was like, I really enjoyed doing this. I really enjoyed talking about gadgets. I really enjoyed talking about technology. I really enjoyed talking about the latest things. And I was like, I'd really like to do a car show. I'd really like to do a car show. I'd really like to do a car program. I'd really like to do a car-based program. I'd really like to do a program about cars. And I was like, how do you do a program about cars? How do you make a program about cars? And I was talking to Chris about it. And he said, why don't you do a program called Top Gear? And I was like, what's Top Gear? I'd never heard of Top Gear. What do you do on Top Gear? I'd never heard of Top Gear. What do you do on it? And he said, you just do a show about cars. You do a show about cars, testing cars. You do a show about cars, comparing cars. You do a show about cars, finding the best car. And I was like, I'll give it a go. I'll give it a shot. I'll have a go. I'll see what I can do. I'll have a go. I'll try it out. I'll see what happens. So I did. I did a piece on Top Gear. I did a test. I did a piece on Top Gear. I did a comparison. I did a piece on Top Gear.
