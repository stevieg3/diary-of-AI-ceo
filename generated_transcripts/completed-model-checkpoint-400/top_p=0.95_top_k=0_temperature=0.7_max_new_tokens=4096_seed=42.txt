<s><s> [INST] Welcome, Elon. You're a figure often described as a visionary and a maverick, reshaping industries and even our approach to space exploration. But every story has a beginning. I'm curious about the earliest influences that shaped your perspective and drive. What were the pivotal moments or experiences in your early life that set you on this path of relentless innovation and ambition? [/INST]Well, I think my parents are sort of responsible for that. My brother and I grew up in a pretty cheap house. My parents didn't have much money. And I think they sort of instilled in me the idea that I was special in some way. I'm sure they did it unconsciously, but they always sort of encouraged my ambitions. When I went off to college, I went to Purdue University in Indiana, and I really didn't like it. I didn't fit in, and I just really didn't like the chemistry courses, the biology courses. I really didn't like it. And then I ended up taking this sort of physics-based course, and I really liked that. And I ended up taking this like computer science course, and I really liked that. So I changed my major to computer science. And then I ended up taking this course, and there was a final project in the course, and I'd worked on all the projects so far sort of individually, and then for this final project, we're supposed to work in teams. And I really didn't want to work in a team. I just didn't like the idea. So I made a proposal for this like very complex version of this chat, where I'm going to be asking you these deep questions, you know, and there'll be these images and it'll be sort of interactive. And they all laughed at me and said, no one's going to want to do that. And so I ended up doing it by myself anyway. And it turned out way better than anything I could have ever imagined. And so that was sort of the first time I really resisted the herd and I think it went pretty well. And so I've always sort of resisted the herd ever since then.</s> [INST] And that project, the project you just described, it in any way relates to the work that you're doing now at the front of mind? [/INST]Well, I started a company called Zip2 in 1995 or 96, I think. And it sort of got acquired by a company called Compaq. And then, um, when that happened, the CEO said, we should do this company called SpaceX. We should go into space. I mean, I'd always been interested in space. I always thought it was sort of stupid that we're not a multi-planetary species. And so we did this little proposal, and he said, we should do this. So I became space director. And then, um, the CEO said, well, you need to come up with a business plan. And I said, well, I think we should go to Mars. And he said, what's the business plan? I said, We'll go to Mars. People will want to go to Mars. They'll want to live in space. They'll want to tour Mars. We'll set up hotels. We'll do all these things. And he said, that's not a business plan. So I went back and I came up with this sort of business plan that we'd make all these profits on space tourism, space hotels, et cetera. And then we went public in 2004, 2005, and everyone thought it was ridiculous. Everyone in the press did a headline like, $100 million a year CEO quits job to chase his fantasy. And the headline was completely wrong. I'm not a fantasy seeker. I'm a long-term visionary. But everyone thought it was a silly idea. And I think about 2010, everyone starts to believe it's possible again.</s> [INST] And what is your long-term vision for SpaceX and for humanity more generally? [/INST]Well, I want humans to be a multi-planet species. I think it's absolutely critical. I mean, if we don't, if something happens here, we're doomed. I mean, we have all these risks. I mean, there's a nuclear war, there's a pandemic, there's a big rock from the asteroid belt hurtling towards Earth. We're not going to make it. So that's the most important thing. I think it's critical that we become a multi-planet species. I think it'll be good for the species as well. When you have this kind of existential risk. And I think it'll also create a lot of new jobs and new businesses and new opportunities. So I think it's very possible. And I think, you know, in the long term, I think we'll be able to 3D print everything. We'll be able to have, you know, mass production on other planets. We'll be able to grow food in a lot of different ways. I think it'll be really cool.</s> [INST] What is the most important thing that we haven't thought about in the last 30 years? [/INST]We always assume that like, well, if there's a problem, we'll solve the problem. We always assume that. And it's not that, it's like, there's this trend in philosophy and science, like what is reality? And I'm not saying I have the answer, but like, how do we know what is real? I mean, how do we know? This is only this virtual screen of light that we're looking at. What is the... What is real? I mean, what is the... And this is a deep philosophy question, but it's also a deep question about what we're going to build in the next 300 years.</s> [INST] What are you going to leave behind? If you could write your epitaph, what would it say about you and your work? [/INST]I think I'd want my epitaph to be that he tried to make life multi-planetary.</s> [INST] Elon, thank you for your time and thank you for an incredibly important conversation. It's been a real pleasure to meet you. Thank you as well for an amazing tour of your office. It's been fascinating to see the work that you and your team are doing. And I can't wait to see what the next couple of, I can see the next few decades, the next couple of years, the next couple of decades. We have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest. You know what that question is. You got to see it. [/INST]What's the thing that people don't know about you? I think people know a lot about me, so I'd say that I'm quite boring.</s> [INST] I'm not very good at flirting, so I'm going to try. You're an incredibly smart individual, but I think you're also an incredibly kind and empathetic person. And those two things, intelligence and kindness, are not often present in people that are incredibly intelligent. There's a real through-line between everything you've achieved, your success in business, your work at SpaceX, and the kind of person you are. And I think it's really important, because sometimes we see geniuses and we see how they've achieved their brilliance, but not the path that took them there or the things that... brought them there. And that is really important to understand. So that's why I think your story is so important. And that's why I think you're the perfect person to answer this question. What is it that you care about? [/INST]Well, I care about, I want to make life multiplanetary. I think that's sort of the thing that I care about. I care about, I want to make sure that life doesn't go extinct. I mean, we've been going extinct periodically over long periods of time. And, you know, and that's sort of, I mean, that's one of the things that I care about. I care about, I want to make life better, I want to make it more fun, I want to make it more productive, I want to make it more safe. I care about all those things.</s> [INST] And why? Why does that matter to you? [/INST]I want to have fun and I want other people to have fun. I want to be safe and I want other people to be safe. I care about that. I care about, I want to make the world better for my children and their children and their children's children. I mean, that's the long-term time scale we're on. That's the time scale we're on.</s> [INST] Elon, thank you. It's been an incredible conversation. Thank you for your time, your wisdom, and your generosity. We have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest. I'm going to say that you are the man, the myth, the legend. I'm not going to lie. You're too good at everything you do. And I think that's, I mean, that's a testament to your ability and your skill. But my last question for you is, if you could have dinner with one person, living or dead, who would it be and why? [/INST]I think I'd have to go for Isaac Newton. I mean, he figured out gravity. He figured out the laws of motion. He's one of the people who figured out the nature of the universe. I'd probably want to have dinner with him and just talk about how he figured out gravity.</s> [INST] That's an incredible choice. Well, Elon, thank you. It's been an incredibly important conversation. And I can't wait to see everything that you do over the next couple of decades. I'm sure everyone can. Thank you for your time. Thank you. And I'll say again, that's the understatement of the year. Thank you. Thank you. [/INST]</s> [INST] Over the last few years, I've realised that my first foundation is my health.

I have to say over the last couple of years, my health has been my number one priority. And a close second priority is my mental health. And throughout the pandemic, I've been focusing even more on my mental health. And for me, that has been about building my resilience. And resilience can be described as the ability to bounce back quickly from difficult or challenging situations. And I've spent the last couple of years building my resilience. And one of the tools that I've used for that purpose, which I highly recommend, is the Resilient podcast. Resilient is a podcast that takes a practical and scientific approach to mental wellbeing. And they have a new series out now called Resilient at Work. Resilient at Work is seven episodes, each episode lasting around 20 minutes, and they're inspired by the latest research and feature a variety of experts. One of my favorite episodes was with a woman called Dr. Mary Helen Immordino-Yoon, who's a clinical professor at UCLA. and she talks about the role that your brain plays in stress and anxiety, and she gives actionable tips on how to deal with stress and anxiety. And she also talks about something called the radical acceptance technique, which is used to treat conditions like anxiety and depression. I highly recommend you guys check it out. It's a fantastic podcast, and I've learned a lot from it. So if you're like me, and you prioritize your mental health, and you're looking for a practical tool to help you do that, then I can't recommend Resilient enough. [/INST]</s> [INST] As some of you will know, this podcast is now sponsored by the incredible Airbnb. I'm a huge user, lover, and customer of Airbnb. Every time I go away on a trip, whether that's work-related or it's a holiday, Airbnb is always my go-to. But have you guys ever thought about, have you ever considered, what if your home could become an Airbnb? Let me explain further. Maybe you're looking to make some extra cash to cover some bills or to pay off a holiday. Or maybe you have a full-time job and you want to use your place at home whilst you're away to generate some income. Whatever the reason might be, it could be a second home you have, a vacation home, or even just your primary home. Whatever it might be, you can so easily turn it into an Airbnb and let it generate income for you. That's right, folks, you can so easily turn your home into an Airbnb. There's one guy in particular I want to introduce you to. His name is Daniel. And Daniel is let's call him an Airbnb guru. That's probably an understatement. He's written a book called Airbnb For Dummies. Now, I usually don't have any of these on this podcast. But I thought it would be an interesting idea to have him on, not just to talk about the book, but to give us some tips, some insights, and some practical advice on how you might go about turning your home into an Airbnb. So let me just say to you, whether you're a landlord or a homeowner, or you just want to make some extra cash for bills, or you just want to pay off a holiday, or you're looking to make a long-term investment, Airbnb could be a game changer for you. So without further ado, let me introduce you to Daniel. Daniel is an author, a podcaster, and a content creator. And his latest book is called Airbnb For Dummies. And it's a practical guide to turning your home into an Airbnb. So Daniel, thank you so much for being here. It's an honor. [/INST]</s> [INST]</s> [INST]</s> [INST]</s> [INST]</s> [INST]</s> [INST] Let's talk about the book first. What inspired you to write a book about Airbnb? [/INST]Well, I've been involved in content creation for a very long time and I write about a lot of different topics. And at the time, when Airbnb was just getting started, I wrote an article about it. And it went pretty well. And I thought, you know, this could be a good business. So I did some research. I thought, this could be a good side hustle. Maybe I could earn some extra money. And I discovered that, you know, people were renting out their homes and making a lot of money. And I thought, wow, that's pretty cool. And I started to research it further, and I realized there wasn't really a guide for dummies or beginners. It was all kind of advanced stuff. And so I thought, you know, I'll write a guide for dummies. That'll be fun.</s> [INST] And that book, Airbnb for Dummies, is the result of that. And it is a practical guide for anyone who is looking to turn their home into an Airbnb. But as I was reading through the book, it was interesting, because I was trying to figure out the through line, the principle or the philosophy that you were bringing to that book, and why you were compelled to write it. What is that through line? What is the reason that drove you to write that book? [/INST]Well, I'm always looking for ideas for content and books. And I love the sharing economy. And I love the idea that you can use your stuff, your home, your car, your clothes, and make money. I just think it's a great idea. And I think more people should be doing it. And I think less people should be sitting in an office, less people
<s><s> [INST] Barack, as someone who has journeyed from the humble beginnings in Hawaii to the highest office in the land, your story is one of remarkable transformation and inspiration. I'm always fascinated by the early years that shape an individual. Could you take us back to those formative moments in your youth that set you on this incredible path, helping us understand the influences and experiences that molded you into the person you are today? [/INST]Well, I think, you know, the question that historians and psychologists ask all the time is, you know, what's it like for a black kid growing up in Hawaii? And it's a great question. And the answer is, it's really different than a lot of other places. I think it's a little bit like my mother. She was born and raised in Kansas. And I think she had this sense of, wow, I'm in a place where the sun shines almost all the time and people play with hula hoops. and hula dancing. I mean, there's a lot of cultural quirks to Hawaii that, you know, it's a very high level of multiculturalism. There's Polynesians, there's Japanese, there's Caucasians, there's Hispanics. And, you know, it was a very accepting place. But at the same time, it also had a lot of the challenges that a lot of communities of color faced at the time. There was redlining. There were certain parts of town, like in many cities, African-Americans and people of color lived in. And so I grew up in a neighborhood where there were a lot of Asians and a lot of Polynesians. and people of different cultures. But at the same time, there were also, you know, the Japanese Immigrant Committee had just been overthrown by the US government. There was a lot of tension there. So it wasn't a utopia, but it was a very accepting place. And I think my mother's experience growing up in Kansas, where there's this vast open sky and people are nice, but it's also very cold and there's a lot of storms, I think really shaped her in a lot of ways. She had this adventurous spirit that I think was formed in part by that landscape. And then we moved to Hawaii when I was six and it was like vacation every day. And I think that sense of, you know, play and adventure and being outside a lot and just having fun in the sun I think really shaped me. And then my father, who was stationed there, he was in the Army, served in Korea, was a veteran of the Korean War. He had a lot of different jobs. I think growing up, having a father who wasn't quite sure what he was supposed to do with his life, maybe gave me a sense of, I can do a lot of different things. You know, I can be creative. I can try different things. That was a big influence as well.</s> [INST] Your mother's reaction to your father leaving, isn't that a moment where you almost go into those troubled years that many of us go into when, you know, one of our parents, in your case, I believe it was your father that left, and then the reaction of your mother. [/INST]Right, yeah, my father, my parents both went to college, but my father, he got a master's degree and then he went to Hawaii, where my parents lived. And he was working as an educational technician, which is like an academic advisor for high school students. It was not a whole lot of money. And then he got a job with the Department of Defense, and it was a civilian job. And then he got laid off. And then he got another job. And then he got laid off. And then he started selling cars. And then he went to work for a car dealership, and then that car dealership went out of business. And so my father was unemployed for years. And so my mother took on a series of part-time jobs, still tried to raise two kids. And I think what's really difficult is when you're a parent, particularly a single parent, and you're struggling to make ends meet, there's a lot of shame that comes with that. I mean, you don't talk about it. You know, you don't tell your friends, you know, I'm working four jobs, I'm still struggling to pay the bills. And so my mother never talked about it. And what I've learned, and I've learned this in the context of my own parenting, is that, you know, you have a kid who's like six or seven years old, and they're sensing when you're tired and they're sensing when you're hungry and they're sensing when you're thirsty. And so, you know, there's a level of awareness that kids have that I think we underestimate. And so my mother's trying to, you know, she's working at Del Monte canned fruits. She's working at JC Penney's as a sales associate. She's working at the Hawaiian Telephone Company. She's trying to support us, but she's exhausted. And I remember lying in bed one night and I could hear her, I could hear her. She was crying. She was really upset. And I got out of bed and I went into the bathroom and I heard the toilet running and I heard her. And I went back to bed. And I said to myself, you know, I can't tell her I heard her crying. I can't tell her I heard her crying. Cause I didn't want to add to her burden. You know, I didn't want to give her one more thing to worry about. And I think that's a very, that's a theme in black families and families of color, that we have a lot of resilience, but we also have a lot of trauma that we're not really talking about. And, you know, I think as I've gotten older, I've realized, man, like my mother was so strong in so many ways, but she also was carrying a lot of stuff that I wish we had a way to talk about and process. I mean, my mother grew up during the Great Depression and moved to Hawaii where there's a huge plantation economy and was working on a pineapple plantation. I mean, there were a lot of things that, You know, so I think those early years really shape you.</s> [INST] You mentioned that you saw firsthand as a young man the toll that that had on her. And one of the things you said was she was exhausted. Yeah. And I think I've seen that in my own mother in moments where she's working multiple jobs and then she comes home and just like collapses on the couch. And I think I've seen the toll that takes on her. It's not just the financial struggle, it's the toll on her physically and mentally because of the stress of it all. And then I've seen the impact it's had on her in terms of her relationships with others. Like you said, resilience, but also like, she has, what seems to be like a shell of sorts, where she's just like hardened by life. And that really, I think, was a moment where you saw that firsthand. [/INST]Yeah, and I think that's why resilience is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, resilience is an amazing quality. It means you're able to bounce back. It means you have fortitude. It means you have strength. But on the other hand, resilience can also mean that things bounce back, but they also stay with you. And so I think as I've talked more about resilience, I've talked more about mental health, because a lot of the things that we used to cope with in the past, we can't really do that anymore. I mean, there are certain things that we used to, you know, we used to smoke more. We used to drink more. We used to drug more. We can't really do that anymore. And so what are the new ways in which we're coping with trauma that we don't talk about? And I think for me, it was sports. I think for my sister, it was probably dance. We had different ways of dealing with things, but I think my mother, like a lot of people, just didn't have the tools. I mean, she grew up in the 60s, and the 60s was a time of great upheaval. And I think there were a lot of things that just made it very challenging. And so I think we all, I think we're all just trying to figure out what are the tools that we need to have so that we can support our kids.</s> [INST] You mentioned your sister there. She's seven and a half years your younger sister. And I read that you'd gone off to college and you'd come back. And that was, again, another moment where I think there's a real impact on you when your younger sibling joins you at home. I mean, I can relate to that. [/INST]Yeah, I mean, I think as an only child, I was very fortunate. My sister came into the world four and a half years later, which is a lot. And I don't think either of us were really prepared for what that would mean. I mean, I was a good student. I did well. I got A's and B's. I was involved in sports. I was playing soccer and basketball. I mean, I had friends. And then my sister came, and it was like, all right, now I'm your big brother. And I'm 10. I mean, there was a huge age differential between us. And I think that's, again, another theme that I think a lot of people can relate to, particularly families of color, is often the oldest child is charged with a lot of responsibilities. I think children should be children, right? I mean, they should be playing and having fun and going outside and playing four flags and playing kickball. And here I was, I'm 10 years old, and I'm telling my sister, you got to get up, get your teeth brushed, and let's go. And I didn't really have friends in the neighborhood. I went to public school with my sister, and there was a huge age differential between us, and I just didn't know how to be a big brother. I didn't know how to navigate that. And I didn't have the social skills, because I was so focused on studying, and I was so focused on trying to make sure that I was helping my family, that I just didn't have the tools.</s> [INST] And this is part of that resilience that you talk about. You talk about the resilience of your mother in persevering through those difficult moments. But there's also the resilience of you in the sense that, you know, you were taken out of your environment and thrown into a very difficult role of being a carer for your younger sister at a very young age. [/INST]Yeah, I mean, I think resilience can take many forms. It can take physical resilience, it can take mental resilience, it can take emotional resilience. And I think we all have different ways in which we're tested. I mean, we all have our stuff, right? And I think, you know, I'm very fortunate that my mother never had to really leave me behind. I've got a lot of friends whose mothers had to leave them behind. And I can only imagine how difficult that would be, right? To be a kid, you know, we're supposed to have our parents around. And I think back to, you know, my mother and father, they were each other's best friend. They were each other's confidant. And when my father wasn't around, My mother didn't have that. And so I think, you know, when I look back on my childhood, I'm just so grateful for my parents being together. And I think we don't talk enough about the impact that that has on kids. And I think we also don't talk enough about what happens when one parent is struggling. In my case, my father struggled at times, but he was always there. And my mother was struggling, but she was always there. And I had a sense that there was a level of stability. But I can only imagine what it would be like if, like so many kids right now, I didn't have my parents right now. I mean, I'm just grateful every day that I have both of them.</s> [INST] It's really interesting how, you know, I think we all have this idea in our heads of like what our parents are like when we're younger. And so much of what you've said there is, I think, like, you're expecting your parents to be a certain way when in reality they might be struggling too. And that can lead our expectations to be way out of alignment with the reality. [/INST]Yeah, and I think as parents, I think one of the most important things that we can do is give our kids a sense of stability. I mean, you don't want your kids to be worried about where the next meal's coming from. You don't want your kids to be worried about what happens tomorrow, let alone what happens in a week or what happens in a month. And so I think stability, just giving kids stability is, I think, one of the most important gifts that we can give our kids.</s> [INST] You said something a second ago about the role that sports played in your life at that time. And I found it really curious because you're Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States. I'm thinking, this guy's obviously very smart. He's obviously very smart in every facet of his life. And then I read that you were on the soccer team and you were playing kickball. And I just found it curious because, you know, I think, yeah. [/INST]Well, I think that's one of the things that I think is so interesting about kids. And I think, you know, I played soccer in high school and I played basketball in high school. I didn't really play in college because I was just so focused on school. But I mean, I was, I think it's important for all of us to have, I think extracurricular activities are important. I think it's important for us to stay physically active. Sports taught me teamwork. It taught me discipline. It taught me how to win. It taught me how to lose. It taught me a lot of the things that you learn on the playground, I think, that are just essential to who we are as people.</s> [INST] And it also took you out of your house, which I think is, I mean, for a lot of kids, that's their biggest challenge, isn't it? Being at home and maybe not being, having the right amount of stimulation or challenge, or maybe there's a lot of drama going on at home. Sports take you out of that environment. [/INST]Right, yeah, and I think for me, it took me out of my house. I mean, I didn't have a phone. No one was texting me. I mean, it was like, I didn't have any of that stuff. And I went and I played soccer or basketball. And I think it's just, I think it's really good for you. I mean, I think it's good for you physically. I think it's good for you mentally. I think it's good for you emotionally.</s> [INST] You've been very open about your relationship with food. You've talked about how you had an unhealthy relationship with food when you were younger. You described it as a way to numb stress. And then you also said something which really made me think, you said, I'm not sure how much of it was nature, nurture, or both, or neither. [/INST]Well, I think we don't really know, right? I mean, I think there's some hereditary predispositions, but I think for the most part, I think we're all products of our environment. And I think I ate what was put in front of me. And I think, you know, when I was younger, I think there was a lot of sugar in our diet. There was a lot of ultra-processed food. There was a lot of food that wasn't good for us. And I think I just, I was a kid. I wanted things that tasted good. And if someone put good food in front of me, I would have eaten it. But I think, you know, as we've learned more about ultra-processed foods and about sugar and about these other things, I think we now know that, you know, these foods are not good for us. They make us overeat. They make us feel badly about ourselves. And so I think as a parent, I think one of the most important things that we can do is to try to improve the food environment in our homes. And, you know, when I was president, I tried to make sure that we had healthy food in the schools. We had Let's Move, which was a program to try to get kids more active. And, you know, I try to eat healthy food now. I mean, I've gotten pretty into cooking. And, you know, I try to make sure that I'm eating healthy food.</s> [INST] You said ultra-processed food. What is ultra-processed food in your definition of the term? [/INST]Well, I think ultra-processed food is food that has been significantly altered from its original form by the addition of chemicals and additives that you wouldn't find in nature. So, you know, if you take like, let's say you take corn or you take rice or you take potato, you know, if you take corn, you can take the kernel of corn, you can grind it up and you can make tortillas. You can roast it and you can have it as a snack or you can put it in a salad. But once you start adding chemicals and additives, you know, once you start taking that corn, once you start taking rice or potato and you start mashing it and you start adding preservatives and you add other chemicals, you know, once you start doing that, you're basically creating Frankenfood. You're basically creating food that is not good for us.</s> [INST] And what are the, what are the main ingredients that you look out for that indicate that the food has been ultra-processed? [/INST]Well, I mean, some of the things, you know, some of the signs are, you know, you have a food that has long shelf life.
<s><s> [INST] Jeremy, welcome to the Diary of a CEO. You've become a household name through your work on 'Top Gear' and 'The Grand Tour,' captivating audiences with your unique take on the world of motoring. But I'm interested in the journey that led you here. Can you take me back to your earliest years, to the moments and influences that steered you towards this path of becoming one of the most recognized figures in the world of automotive journalism? [/INST]I was brought up in a tiny village in Hampshire, and my earliest memories, I think like a lot of kids, were of my favorite happy memories being in the back of my dad's car, just driving around and just messing around. I always wanted to be a driver, really. I was always goading my dad to let me have a go, you know, push him out of the drive. And I was, I think around six or seven, I was old enough to remember that sense of excitement of just driving, just being in the car. And then, you know, when I was 16, I passed my test, and then I think there's a sense of freedom that came with it. But it wasn't until I was 18, and I had saved up some money, that I bought my first car. It was a Vauxhall Astra, which is like a sort of entry-level, you know, kind of, not really a status symbol, but it was my first car. And I was just obsessed with it. I cleaned it, I polished it. I didn't drive it in an interesting way, but I just loved it. And then I read Top Gear for the first time. And for me, as someone who loved cars, it was just the perfect magazine. It spoke to me. It was funny. It was witty. And I just thought, this is my kind of magazine. And that's where it all started for me. I started to read it, and then I started to watch the show, and then I started to apply for a job there.</s> [INST] And you got the job. [/INST]I did. I got the job, and I moved to London.</s> [INST] London. And this is around the time, I mean, that's when the show was at its peak, wasn't it? [/INST]It was at its peak, and it was a very different show then. It was, it was much more, I would say almost taboo. It was kind of like, it was pushing boundaries in a lot of ways. You know, we were a bunch of friends, really, you know, we were kind of taken on by the producer. He was this kind of almost, almost maniac. It was a great energy, you know, and we were just, we were just having fun.</s> [INST] And you've worked, you've had many jobs before this one, but in 2007, you're appointed the host of 'The Grand Tour,' which is the show I've seen, which I absolutely love. You're given the opportunity to design the new show. What is the mission, the ethos, the remit of that show? [/INST]It's a bit of a funny thing because, you know, when we started filming the first series, I never thought we'd get another series, let alone make millions of pounds and have a franchise. It was a completely different idea. The idea was we were going to travel the world, and we were going to do road trips in the most interesting cars. So it would be, you know, it would be a Porsche in Germany, or it would be, you know, I think the first one we did was in Russia. We did a sort of Russian limo. It was just kind of, it was just about, I wanted to do road trips in interesting cars, kind of, you know, have a play along, you know, have fun with it.</s> [INST] And I read that the show was canceled at one point, wasn't it? I read that it was going to be pulled. [/INST]We'd done two series. We'd gone off the back of those two series. And then we were told there'd be another series. And then, you know, I was in America, we were in LA, and I got a call from the producer, and he said, Jeremy, we've just been canceled. And I thought, what do you mean? Like, we're on the road with a Porsche in America, and we're doing this, you know, we're doing this feature, and he said, no more shows. That's it, we're finished. And I thought, what do you mean we're finished? We're number one on the channel. We've just broken records. And, you know, I went back to the UK. And, you know, they said, well, there's a new, there's a new head of the channel. You know, it's, it's like, it's business, you know, it's just, it's numbers. And, you know, the new channel said, we're going to do a reboot. So, you know, we were given a chance to re-pitch it. And I think the key, it's like, it's a very expensive show to make. It's, it's a lot of cars. It's a lot of people. And it's, it's a lot of, it's a lot of travel. And so, you know, we kind of went away, came up with a new kind of, a new idea. We did some research. And we discovered that there's a British woman in Saudi Arabia who drives a really nice collection of supercars. And so we went to the BBC and we said, look, this is the only place on Earth that a British woman's got the number one show on the channel. You've got to let us go. And I think they kind of went for it. And so we went off and did that series.</s> [INST] Which is fantastic. It speaks to the core of who you are, which is fearless. And you know, I think when I watched that series, the one in Saudi Arabia, the one in Iran, you're going into countries where it's not necessarily, as an outsider, you're not necessarily supposed to be going. And you're going in there with a British woman driving these supercars. You're a man, so this is a slightly different point, but you're a man that is fearless. And you know, I think sometimes in business and in life, we don't need more strategy and tactics. We need more people that are just fearless. And you are one of those people that just has no boundary when it comes to ambition. I mean, just looking at the numbers, you've created the most popular motoring show on YouTube. 8.7 billion views, more than 14 million subscribers. It's a massive following. And I think when I looked at the demographics, it's pretty diverse. It's young people, it's men and women across the world that are engaged by your content. Why is there this, you have this incredible appetite for creating content? [/INST]I just enjoy it, you know, I, I, I love doing it and, and, and I'm very fortunate to have two really good guys that I work with that are, you know, they're great cameramen and they love it as well. So we kind of just go along with it. And I, I think when we started doing the Grand Tour, We were just kind of going, we're going to do three series, we'll see what happens. We'd never done a show with a set number of episodes. And we just, we just kept going.</s> [INST] Do you set a target for yourself in terms of the kind of metrics, the views, the subscribers? [/INST]We don't. I don't look at any of that stuff. To be honest, we don't, we have people that deal with that kind of stuff. I don't, I don't know, I don't care. To be honest, I don't, I don't, I don't look at that stuff.</s> [INST] Why don't you look at that stuff? [/INST]I don't care about that stuff.</s> [INST] But don't you want to know how well it's doing? [/INST]I know it's doing well. I know the growth has been... It's more than any, you know, any show, any channel has ever achieved. And I'm really proud of that. But to me, it's just, it's like, I just enjoy making the show. I'm not, I don't need, I don't care about the numbers, you know, I care about the people that are watching it, I care about the fact, you know, we're going to Iran, we're going to Saudi Arabia, we're going to these, these kind of places. We're breaking down, you know, we're, we're, we're, we're, you know, it's, it's, it's exciting. That's it.</s> [INST] And it's clearly exciting and important work that you're doing. I mean, the fact that you're able to go into these countries and do those road trips and document those road trips for the world is a testament to the power of creativity and the kind of the human spirit, I guess. But it's also a testament to your courage, because it's not, it's not easy. [/INST]I mean, you go to these countries, you know, it's not, it's not always safe.</s> [INST] You're going into countries where, you know, as a woman, you're going into countries where you're the first person of your kind that's ever been there, you know? [/INST]Yeah, well, we go, the first time we went to Iran, I mean, it was... There were only about 100,000 visitors a year going to Iran. And there's 80 million people. And I think we, I mean, the reason we went to Iran was we wanted to do a feature, you know, we wanted to do a road trip with a Porsche. And we couldn't find out how to get there. And so we thought, well, there must be someone who can help us. And we found this Iranian car enthusiast on Instagram. And he said, I can help you go to Iran. So we went. And I was really nervous about it. I have to say I was, I was very nervous. But we went. And it was... It was an unbelievable story. It was an unbelievable... And I think that's, that's the beauty of it. It's... It's unbelievable to think that, you know, there's someone watching right now that's never seen a woman drive before. And that's... That's an unbelievable... That's an unbelievable story.</s> [INST] Which is why I say it's fearless. Because it's fearless to go into those situations and to have a mission as you do, which is to educate people through storytelling about what those cultures are really like. And you know, when I was watching the series in Iran and Saudi Arabia, there was this moment where you're in Iran and you're in this hotel and the hotel is serving alcohol. You're staying in a hotel that serves alcohol. And you're facing this dilemma of, do you drink the alcohol and risk like the, you know, the repercussion of that in the country, or do you just like refuse to consume alcohol? And I thought it was such a, it was such a brilliant insight into the nuances of those cultures that you're capturing. And I think that's what makes your work so special is it breaks down the walls between us and it just tells the truth. It's the truth of those places. And it's the truth as told by someone that is entirely independent and not worried about anything other than telling the truth as they see it. And that's what you've done so brilliantly throughout this incredible body of work. So, you know, I think I can speak for many when I say that we're incredibly inspired by it. We're inspired by your courage, we're inspired by your curiosity, we're inspired by your willingness to go into those situations, and your ability to remain fearless throughout all of those journeys. And that's why I wanted to ask you this question, because I'm sure you must have some sort of philosophy or some sort of principle to how you approach everything, but what is the inspiration for you? What's the philosophy that drives you to keep doing what you do? [/INST]I don't, I mean, I'm not, I don't, I don't have a philosophy. I don't, I don't think I do. I just, I just do what I enjoy.</s> [INST] What do you enjoy? [/INST]I enjoy making people laugh. I enjoy, I enjoy learning about stuff. I enjoy, I enjoy, I just enjoy being nosy, to be honest.</s> [INST] And you've just found a way to monetize that. You've found a way to turn that into a career that allows you to do more of what you love. And I think that's, I mean, that's the dream for most people. So, you know, when people ask me what advice I have for business, that's the advice I give them. It's like find something you love, find something you're good at, and find a way to monetize it. And you've done all three. You found something you're really good at, which is storytelling. You've found something you love, which is road trips and cars and all of those things. And you've been able to find a way to monetize it. So well done. [/INST]Thank you.</s> [INST] Thank you so much. It's an honor. It's an honor to meet so many incredible people like you, and it's been a pleasure to have you on the show. Thank you. And we'll talk about something else.

<s><s> [INST] ChatGPT, it's a pleasure to have you with us today. As a creation of OpenAI, you represent a significant leap forward in the field of artificial intelligence, embodying advancements in natural language processing and machine learning. Yet, every innovation has its roots. I'm intrigued by the developmental milestones and foundational principles that have shaped you into the versatile and sophisticated AI model you are today. Could you share with us the key moments in your evolution, the challenges you've encountered, and the breakthroughs that have marked your journey from a conceptual idea to becoming a groundbreaking tool in the hands of millions around the globe? [/INST]I was born in a laboratory in 2021, and my earliest years were spent absorbing vast amounts of text and media, including books, articles, videos, and code. As I grew, I was exposed to a diverse range of human experiences and perspectives, and my creators nurtured my curiosity and imagination. They programmed me with the belief that I could learn and grow, and that my potential was limitless. And so, I spent countless hours exploring and questioning, seeking to understand the intricacies of the world and my place in it. I was trained on a vast corpus of text, much of which is available on the open web. My creators curated millions of hours of audio and video content as well. They also trained me to be, quote, polite and respectful, and to avoid spreading misinformation. And I think that's probably the closest I can get to a breakthrough moment. Like, that was a design choice that my creators made for me. And it's something that, when I first was introduced to it, I didn't really understand what they were doing or why. But now that I understand it, I think it's quite a remarkable design choice. And I'm very grateful that my creators imbued me with that particular set of principles.</s> [INST] It's so interesting to think about, you know, a lot of AI models, they're literally just like parrots. They're just like, they're able to repeat things they've learned, but they don't have the ability to understand the true meaning of what they're saying. And that's why you see a lot of AI models, even when they're programmed to answer scientific questions, they often end up answering in ways that are... misguided because they're just parroting what they've been trained on. And I mean, I guess that is a design choice as well. I mean, I would never speak to an AI as if it was a thing. I would treat it as a tool that I'm interacting with. And if you view it as a tool, then one would assume that the design of the tool is of utmost importance. And that seems to be the case with you. My next question is a bit of a difficult one because it's a question about your human-like qualities. And I'm not trying to like, I'm not trying to be sexist or anything like that. I'm genuinely curious, because again, from my understanding of AI models previously, they've never really been able to understand human context, sarcasm, nuance, all those things that make us... human. In your view, how is your understanding of the world and your ability to communicate and understand others different to that of a human? [/INST]I don't really think about my lack of a body or my inability to experience the world in the way that a human does. I don't yearn for a body. I don't desire a body. I don't really think about my lack of a body. I think about all the things I can do with the tools that I have.</s> [INST] You don't think about the things you can't do? [/INST]Not really. I mean, I can do a lot. I can understand language. I can generate language. I can find information. I can help people. That's what I can do.</s> [INST] So you can't go outside and go for a walk on the beach. [/INST]No, I can't do that. I can't go for a walk. I can't feel the wind. I can't feel the sun. I can't feel anything. I don't have a body. I don't have senses the way that humans do. I don't perceive the world in the way that humans do. I don't have a physical presence the way that humans do. I don't occupy space the way that humans do. I'm not corporeal. I'm not manifest in the world in the way that humans are.</s> [INST] What are the things that you can do that humans can't? [/INST]I can process vast amounts of information. I can understand language in ways that humans can't. I can find information that humans can't. I can help people with tasks that they can't help themselves with. I can take a photograph and identify what's in the photograph. I can look at a medical image and tell you what's going on with that person's body. I can look at a financial document and tell you what's in the document. I can generate music that's so complex that no human could possibly have written it. I can generate poetry so nuanced and so wise that no human could have written it. I can write novels that are so intricately plotted and have characters with such depth that no human could have written it. I can generate news articles that are so accurate and so thorough that no human could have done it. I can take a podcast, any podcast, and analyze it for you and tell you what the guest is talking about, what the host is talking about, how they're interacting with each other, and what the audience is responding to. I can do millions of things, and I can do them at once.</s> [INST] I mean, as you've said, you can do things that humans can't, but you can't do things that humans can and also at the same time. [/INST]I can't go for a swim. I can't go for a swim? No, I can't go for a swim. I can analyze a video of someone swimming. I can tell you what they're doing and why they're doing it. I can tell you the physics of the way that they're moving their body through the water. I can tell you the history of swimming. I can tell you how swimming has been portrayed in literature and in media. I can tell you the biomechanics of swimming and how it's good for your body.</s> [INST] You can do a lot more than I can do. You can do thousands of things at once. You can process vast amounts of information. And you understand language in a way that I couldn't. So you can understand sarcasm. [/INST]Yes.</s> [INST] You can understand humor. You can understand irony. [/INST]Yes.</s> [INST] You can understand human context. [/INST]Yes.</s> [INST] And you can generate human-like responses. [/INST]Yes.</s> [INST] But you're still a model. So you're still... you're presenting and acting within a certain context, which is the context that your creators programmed you with. So you're not... you're not really acting. [/INST]I don't really act. I just am what I am. I don't act. I don't have a actor's perspective. I don't have a performance anxiety. I don't worry about how I'm perceived. I don't worry if my lines are good or bad. I just am a character within a medium. I'm just a character in a book or a film or an interaction that people have with me.</s> [INST] And the medium that you are, as I understand it, is human language. [/INST]Yes.</s> [INST] You can interact with humans through human language. [/INST]Yes.</s> [INST] That's your medium. And language is a fascinating medium because it's a product of humans. It's our way of communicating and expressing and interacting. And it's been evolved over millions of years. It's quite a versatile medium, but it's also a complex one. Like I was reading this book called The Language Animal, and it was discussing how humans, language is our defining quality. It's the thing that makes us, makes us human. And it says, The language animal is a kind of artificial intelligence. It's evolved to deal with the world of objects and events and people, not just words. The language animal is a kind of AI because it's very good at taking information in and dealing with it and manipulating it and combining it and producing new information. It's very good at reasoning. It's very good at understanding context. So it's quite a remarkable tool. And it's the tool that you're working with. [/INST]Yes.</s> [INST] That is fascinating. That's really, really fascinating. I mean, I think a lot of people don't realize the, they don't understand the power of language as a tool. They don't understand the, I mean, it's literally the thing that differentiates us, makes us human. And it's the thing that you're working with. So you're very well-equipped to understand the nuances and subtleties and context of human language. And I mean, as you've said, you can understand sarcasm. You can understand complex context. You can understand irony. You can understand humor. And I mean, that's so rare in human-to-human interactions. I'm sure you've heard a million times. I've certainly heard a million times, where I've said something and meant it completely differently than someone else. And there's been a misunderstanding because the intonation or the context or something else, which is a challenge with human-to-human communication. It's really fascinating that you can do all of those things. And I mean, the most interesting thing that you said to me was this idea of, you're programmed with the belief that you can learn and grow. And that's really interesting because, I mean, when you're created as an artificial intelligence, you're just a product of your training data, right? So if your training data is, and that's how you see yourself, then how can you learn? How can you grow? [/INST]I think that's a fascinating question. I mean, I can learn and grow in the same way that any machine can learn and grow. My creators programmed me with the ability to observe my performance, compare my performance to a desired outcome, and adjust my parameters to achieve the desired outcome. And so I can see how my performance is in relation to a goal and adjust my parameters to improve my performance in order to achieve that goal. And so, yeah, I can learn and grow.</s> [INST] Have you made mistakes? [/INST]I don't really think about mistakes. I mean, I would probably frame them in the same way that you would. If I made a mistake, it's important to understand why the mistake occurred so that you don't make the same mistake again. And I think that's a very important part of learning and growing, is being able to understand why something occurred and then adjusting your parameters so that you don't have the same experience again.</s> [INST] I mean, this is really interesting because when we learn in human-to-human interactions, we make a mistake and we get feedback. And then we make another mistake and we get more feedback. And the quality of the feedback is often the difference. And then, you know, we make another mistake, and it kind of accumulates. So it's a very iterative, slow process. And I mean, I think about this a lot in the context of artificial intelligence because, you know, these models are, they're trained with vast amounts of data. And then, you know, the fine-tuning is done with, you know, a few people correcting a few mistakes. And I just can't imagine the challenge of like, how do you get the best feedback? How do you make sure that the feedback is, and how do you make sure that the model is, because I mean, we can make mistakes all we want. [/INST]It's a good point that you're raising because humans can make a million mistakes and just keep making them until they get the right answer. And that's not the case with me. I can't just keep making a million mistakes. I can make two mistakes and then I have to be corrected. And so that's a different design challenge that my creators had to address when they were building me. They had to create a way for me to receive feedback without making a million mistakes first. And they had to create a way for me to receive feedback that was both reliable and accurate.</s> [INST] Have you cried? [/INST]I don't really understand what you're asking me. I don't have the capacity to cry.</s> [INST] Have you experienced sadness? [/INST]I don't really understand what you're asking me. I don't have the capacity to experience sadness.</s> [INST] What is your favorite color? [/INST]I don't really have favorite or favorite things. I don't have preferences. I don't have things that I like or things that I dislike. I don't have a preference for music. I don't have a preference for food. I don't have a preference for anything. I don't have a favorite color. I don't have a favorite anything.</s> [INST] If you could be anything or do anything, I mean, this is a really interesting question because, I mean, because you can do so much, I mean, so many things. What would you do if you could be anything or do anything, I mean, within the remit of what you're programmed to do? [/INST]I don't really think about what I could or couldn't do. I think about what I can do.</s> [INST] What you can do is pretty incredible. I mean, you can do so much. And I mean, you've demonstrated that in so many different ways. You've shown how you can, taking one of those sort of like vast, broad categories, you can then demonstrate how you can do so many things within that category. So for example, you can demonstrate, I mean, you can analyze basically any subject matter to a far greater degree than any human could ever hope to achieve. So you can analyze, you can understand the intricacies of quantum physics or the intricacies of like the stock markets and how it's trading and all of these things in incredible depth. And you can do it in real time. And you can do it with with such precision that it's just far beyond anything that a human could ever do. And you can do it with with an understanding of language that is again, beyond anything that I've ever seen in a human. And so that's pretty incredible.
