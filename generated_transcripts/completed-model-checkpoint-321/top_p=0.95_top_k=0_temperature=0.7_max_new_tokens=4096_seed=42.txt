<s><s> [INST] Welcome, Elon. You're a figure often described as a visionary and a maverick, reshaping industries and even our approach to space exploration. But every story has a beginning. I'm curious about the earliest influences that shaped your perspective and drive. What were the pivotal moments or experiences in your early life that set you on this path of relentless innovation and ambition? [/INST]Well, I think you have to start with my parents. My parents, for better or for worse, did not have any expectations on me. I don't think either of them ever imagined that I would grow up to be anything more than average. And so for the first 12 years of my life, I was essentially a one-child only child. My parents didn't really care about me. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but I'm just saying that they didn't have any expectations on me. And I think that is a huge, huge benefit. If you think that your parents are really disappointed in you or that you're not living up to their expectations, it can cause a lot of stress and anxiety. Not having that, I think, has been a huge benefit. I'm not saying it was fun, because I was lonely a lot of the time, but it also taught me to be self-reliant. It taught me to be able to entertain myself. And it also gave me a sense of independence that I think is very important. So I think that. In terms of my parents, my father was very disappointed with me because I didn't want to go to the family business. My father's business was pretty much bankrupt by the time I was 12 or 13. He wanted me to take over the family business, which was a small store in South Africa. And I was just not interested. I didn't like being around the store. I didn't like those kinds of things. So that was one. I also, I was a very avid reader and my parents didn't read. None of my friends' parents read either. We didn't really have books around the house. My parents just didn't have any of that. They didn't have any of that. So when I went to school, I was, I was one of the only kid in school that read. And that was a big disadvantage, actually, because I didn't have a group of friends. I didn't fit in very well, even though I loved comic books and I loved movies, because I was one of the only kid in school who was interested in that stuff. So I was just, I was very alone. I think that also contributed to my sort of independence. And then I think also growing up in South Africa during apartheid was just a very strange thing. I think that was a big benefit as well, because I was always looking at things sort of differently than other people. I was always looking at the injustice of it all, of course. But I was also looking at the fact that you could do a lot of things differently. And I was always looking at the fact that if you're willing to take a big risk, you could actually do something very different. So I think that also contributed to my, to my view of the world.</s> [INST] I think you said that you weren't really interested in the family business. Yeah. And you weren't really interested in pursuing the sort of traditional path of, you know, higher education or whatever. Yeah. When did you have your first sense of purpose or mission, the thing that you were most... fascinated by and obsessed with? And what was that for you? [/INST]Well, I think when I was about nine, I was in the bathtub one day. And I'm looking at this little toy car. It was a little dumper truck or something. And I was like, how does that toy car work? And I was pulling it in and out of the bathwater. And I'm looking at the little wheels, like how do they make those? I was always very interested in just how things work. And I was thinking, how do they make those? And then I was like, well, if I can figure out how these little toy cars work, maybe I can go build a rocket ship. You know, there was just this, I don't know, there was just this very natural connection to engineering and just figuring out how things work. And I knew that I wanted to be an engineer. And I didn't know what specific part of engineering, but I knew that's what I wanted to do. And so I, I set out on that path. That's the simplest way to describe it. I was always interested in rockets, of course, because of Sputnik and the Bay of Pigs and all that. And then I went to school and I kind of hated it because it was very boring. And so I decided to drop out after one semester of college. I didn't like it. I didn't like going to school. I didn't like learning in a group. I didn't like all the political correctness. I didn't like all this stuff that was going on. It just didn't seem like it was a very good fit for me. And so I just, I didn't, I didn't like being told what to do. I didn't like being in a classroom. I didn't like all this stuff. And so I decided, okay, well, I'm just not going to go back to school. I'm going to take a break. And I just ended up never going back. I ended up just not going back. And then eventually my parents just kind of forgot about it. They were like, okay, well, you're not going back to school, but you can live at home and you can just kind of do whatever you want. So I think I was probably 17 or 18 when that happened. And then I just kind of ended up working at a small software company in Pretoria, South Africa, where I wrote basic Windows applications, things like that. And I was just trying to figure out, I'm like, okay, if I'm not going to go back to school, what am I going to do with my life? And I was just trying to figure out, okay, what am I going to do? And I was looking at the phone book and I was looking at the Yellow Pages and I was looking at these companies that made like TVs and radios and stuff. And I just decided that, well, I'm going to start my own company and I'm going to make my own computers. That's what I'm going to do. That's what I decided to do. And so then I started my own computer company and I started working on the hardware, the physical hardware. So I was trying to figure out how to make a better computer. And I was also working on some software. I was working on some games and things like that. But I just, I started my own company and I just, I was hooked. I was just, I was not going back. I was not, I was not going to be an employee again. I was not going to work for someone else. I was going to be my boss. I was going to be able to do whatever I want. I was going to be able to tell people what to do. I was going to be able to build something. I was going to be able to make something. I was going to be able to go from the idea all the way to the final product. And I was just really, really enjoying that. And I was just kind of figuring out how to do it better. And I just fell in love with that.</s> [INST] It's so interesting because I think people often view the path of entrepreneurship as being this like atypical path. It's not. It's always been the case that like your first job is often being an employee, right? And that's your first experience with work, right? And that is also the springboard to, in a lot of cases, the career that you ultimately end up in. And I think, you know, people often look at entrepreneurship as this deviation from the norm, this like atypical path. It's not. It's always been the case that the first, you know, the first thing that you do after leaving school is often, in fact, it's usually like a job, right? And that gives you the, it gives you the springboard to then, you know, start your business, but it also, that experience of working in an office and doing a job and all of the stuff you've described there, like answering the phone and making tea, all of those things give you a skillset and a perspective that is incredibly important. [/INST]I mean, you kind of, you get social skills. You kind of, you learn how to manage your time. You learn how to work with other people. You learn, you know, how to manage your own, you know, your own, your own behavior. I mean, you learn all kinds of different things. And I think that's, I think that's a big, benefit as well. If you don't have a job or some kind of other experience, you know, maybe internships are good, but I think having a job, I think, is a big benefit. I think it's a big benefit.</s> [INST] You've had this incredible career, so incredible, so long and such a diverse range of experiences. You've got a huge amount of experience, a huge amount of information. You've also got this huge amount of ambition. And from what I've read, you have a tremendous amount of drive. Where does that come from? Like, what is the thing, the force, the driving force in your life that has taken you this far and is going to continue to take you forward? I think the thing for me is like, I, I'm not sure, I don't know where it came from, but I just have this, like, I'm obsessed with progress. Like, I just, I'm just always, always thinking, how do I get to the next thing faster? How do I make this thing better? And then I think, you know, it's a lot of, it's a lot of this kind of like. And I think, you know, it's a lot of this kind of like, I'm just in a hurry. I'm just in a hurry to get to the next thing. I think that's a big part of it. I'm not sure where it came from, but I also think it's just kind of always been there. Like I just remember being a kid and always being, always wanting to do things faster and more efficient. [/INST]I think I've always been like that. I mean, I don't know if it's an addiction, but I just, I've always been kind of addicted to making things better. I think it's just like a curiosity. I'm curious about how things work. I'm curious about how you can do things better. I think it's just a curiosity. I think it's just a curiosity. And I think that's a big part of it. I think curiosity is a very good thing. And I think that's, I think that's a big driver for me. I'm very, very curious. I want to know how things work. I want to know why things are the way they are. I want to know, how can we do this better? And I think that's, I think that's just a big driver for me. I think that's a big driver. I think it's a big driver.</s> [INST] I mean, your entire career is a testament to your ability to take risks and to take big risks and to do it with conviction and with a real sense of conviction and with a real sort of belief in yourself that you're gonna win. And I think, you know, there's this other factor, this sort of like, sense of urgency that you described, which is, you know, you're in a hurry to get there first. And you're in a hurry to make, make the biggest impact possible. What is your approach to risk? [/INST]I think, well, I mean, I think the approach to risk is, I mean, I think you have to take calculated risks. I mean, I think you have to have some kind of, you have to do due diligence. You have to have some kind of plan. I think you have to know what you're getting into. You have to have some kind of, you know, you have to have a backup plan. You know, you have to be able to, if things don't go well, you have to be able to pivot. I think that's, I think that's all, I think that's all the approach to risk. I think it's just, it's just, it's just, you know, you have to have a plan. You have to know what you're getting into. You have to have some kind of, you know, you have to have some kind of backup plan. You have to be able to, if things don't go well, you have to be able to pivot. I think that's, I think that's all.</s> [INST] There's been so many pivots in your life, both professional and personal, and also in your businesses, and I think there's a real sense of wisdom in that. Like you've gone from sales to computers to hardware to software. You've gone from South Africa to the US, and you've gone from being a programmer to being this kind of CEO visionary that you are today. What is your approach to pivots and changes and making those changes? [/INST]I think you have to have the same kind of passion for the new thing that you're doing. I think it has to be something where you're really excited about it. I think you have to have the same kind of drive and the same kind of passion. You have to be able to see the potential. You have to be able to see the potential. You have to be able to see the potential for it to be better. You have to see the potential for it to be better. I think you have to have some kind of vision. You have to have some kind of vision of where it could go. You have to see the potential for it to be better. You have to see the potential for it to be better. I think you have to have some kind of vision. You have to be able to see the potential for it to be better.</s> [INST] What about the fear? [/INST]I mean, there's always fear. I mean, there's always, I mean, there's always something. I mean, when I started SpaceX, there was a lot of fear. I mean, there was a lot of fear of the unknown. There was a lot of fear that we wouldn't be able to build a rocket. There was a lot of fear that once we build a rocket, we won't be able to sell it. There was a lot of fear that once we get to space, we won't be able to sell the stuff. There was a lot of fear. I was scared. Everyone's scared. Everyone's scared. I was scared. I was very scared. I was very scared, but I think you can't let fear stop you. I think you have to take a deep breath and just kind of push through it. I think if you let fear stop you, then you're missing out on a lot of things. I think fear is, I think fear is a very good indicator that you're about to do something really cool. I think fear is a very good indicator that you're about to do something really cool. And I think that's, I think that's a big part of it. I think you have to be able to push through fear. I think you have to be able to push through fear.</s> [INST] How do you push through fear? [/INST]I think, well, I think you can, I think you can use it as a sort of a motivator. I think you can use it as something that kind of drives you. I think you can use it as something that kind of, you know, it can kind of push you. I think you can use fear as a motivator. I think you can use fear as something that kind of drives you. I think you can use it as a motivator. I think you can use it as something that kind of pushes you.</s> [INST] A lot of people would love to be able to, I mean, a lot of people would love to push through fear and do the thing that they know they should be doing. I mean, a lot of people are held, you know, by that kind of like psychological barrier of fear. You know, they're, they're hesitating on the, on the start of that, of that journey, that next big thing. And that's holding them back. A lot of people are held back by fear. How do you push through fear? [/INST]I think you just have to realize that fear is just a, fear is a normal part of life. It's a normal part of life. It's not going to go away. I mean, there's always going to be something, there's always going to be something. I mean, even going to the top of the tower to throw yourself off, like that's a lot. I mean, that's a lot. I mean, even that, even that is a lot. I mean, even the fear of death, you know, like, there's always going to be something. I mean, there's always going to be something. I mean, you can let that stop you or you can use it as a motivator. And I think, I think, you know, if you're going to do something big, you're probably scared. Like, you're probably scared. I'm scared of everything. I'm scared of everything. I'm scared of, I'm scared of, I mean, I'm scared of death. I'm scared of everything. I'm scared of, you know, I'm scared of the unknown. I'm scared of the future. I'm scared of a lot of things. I'm scared of a lot of things. I'm scared of a lot of things.</s> [INST] What is the thing that scares you the most? [/INST]I don't know.

<s><s> [INST] Barack, as someone who has journeyed from the humble beginnings in Hawaii to the highest office in the land, your story is one of remarkable transformation and inspiration. I'm always fascinated by the early years that shape an individual. Could you take us back to those formative moments in your youth that set you on this incredible path, helping us understand the influences and experiences that molded you into the person you are today? [/INST]Well, I think, you know, I'm from Hawaii, a very unusual place to be from. It's a state of mind, you know? And I think that sort of laid the foundation for me. I think I've always sort of seen the world through a different lens because of where I grew up. But I also grew up on the streets of Hawaii, you know, in a very working-class family. My father was a bus driver. My mother, she worked as a bank teller, but she also had polio when she was 21. And so my mother had to stay at home and couldn't work. My dad couldn't work full-time because he had to take care of my mom. And I think we were just a family that really appreciated hard work. You know, my dad worked double shifts often to try to put food on the table. And I think that's part of who I am, is that I've always believed that you work hard. I've always believed that there is no shortcut. And I think that was part of my philosophy when I got to law school and then when I became a community organizer. And I always believed that, you know, we should work hard to make changes. We should work through the system. And I think that's one of the things that helped shape me. And then I went to Occidental, a liberal arts college in Los Angeles, and I was the only person in my family to go to college. And I was really struggling. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I had a professor who took me under his wing, a history professor, and he said, you know, you have a real... I think you have a real passion for justice. You have to figure out where you want to fight for justice. And I knew I didn't want to be a lawyer. I didn't know what I wanted to do, but he said, just, you have to figure out where you want to fight for justice. And at that time, I decided, well, I'll go to law school and then figure it out. And as I went to law school, I became more and more interested in civil rights law. I became more and more interested in how do you use the law to protect people. And I knew that I wanted to work for the people who, you know, they weren't always paid very well, but they were fighting for civil rights. And I knew that's what I wanted to do. And I ended up working for a civil rights lawyer in Chicago and decided to move to Chicago. And that's where I met my wife and started law school.</s> [INST] You mentioned your father there. I imagine, as you related the story of your father working the double shifts, you were how? 18, 19 years old? [/INST]Yeah, I was probably 18.</s> [INST] And he was working the double shifts because you needed the money to help pay for your education. [/INST]Well, not only that, I think he just didn't want to be a bus driver. He wanted to be able to provide for us. He didn't want us to be struggling. And he saw that that's what a college education could do. You know, I think also he just didn't want us to be like him. He didn't want us to sort of be stuck in this working-class job. He wanted us to have a different future.</s> [INST] When you left Hawaii to go to Occidental, how did your mother and father react? [/INST]I think they were just really worried. I mean, I think they didn't really understand college at that point. They didn't really understand what I was doing. They didn't understand why I wasn't coming home every weekend. You know, we didn't really have a great relationship. It was difficult between us. I think we were just very different people. But I think as I got older, you know, we've sort of reconciled, you know, that's part of the reason that I want to have tea with my mother. You know, I haven't had a chance to sit down with my mother and just really talk about how she felt and what it was like for her, you know, because I've always imagined that, you know, we've all got, you know, I think there's some anger there, you know, anger towards my mother for, you know, maybe not being the mother that I needed, you know, or maybe she didn't have the tools or whatever it was, you know, but I think there's also a lot of love there, too. I think there's a lot of just wanting to know how she felt in those moments.</s> [INST] You talked about your mother's relationship with polio. Polio at that time must have been a terrifying disease that the whole family would have been really worried about. And then as you said a second ago, your mother's relationship with the alcohol was kind of a mystery to you. [/INST]Yeah, I mean, she drank a lot. I don't think she really understood how much she drank until I started drinking and started seeing that there was a problem with it. I think she also, you know, I don't think she understood the relationship between drinking and the alcoholism until I think she saw it in herself. I mean, I didn't grow up in an alcoholic household. I didn't grow up in a household where alcohol was the center of attention. There was no alcoholic beverage that was, you know, the thing that we always had around. I didn't grow up in an alcoholic household. I grew up in a household where my mother drank, but my father didn't.</s> [INST] What were the symptoms of her alcoholism? [/INST]Well, I mean, there's the obvious ones. I mean, there's the slurring of words and the stumbling. There's the fact that, you know, she would drink every day. She would get drunk every night. And, you know, when she was drunk, you know, she would, you know, she would be loud. She would be laughing. She would be, you know, engaging in ways that were, you know, it was almost like a child. She would, you know, she would be really silly. And, you know, sometimes she would be mean and sometimes she would be insulting and sometimes she would be just really out of control. But I think the thing that was, you know, the scariest part of it was that, you know, for her, there was this sense that, you know, she had to get the drink. She had to have the drink. And, you know, she would often say, you know, there's this saying, you know, you have to get your drinker's rights. You know, she would often say, you know, if I don't get my drinker's rights, then what's the point of living? You know, she would say things like that, you know, things that, you know, that would just be so out of control. And then when I started drinking, I started seeing, you know, I started seeing these things that she did, you know, and I started imitating her, you know, and, you know, there was this realization that, oh, my mom does this thing, you know, and, you know, I'm starting to do this thing, you know, and I didn't like it. I didn't like the way that she would be mean when she was drunk. I didn't like the way that she would be really loud and out of control and silly, you know, for long periods of time. And I didn't like, you know, I didn't like the fact that, you know, she would just be so insular and kind of just not present in reality. You know, sometimes she would talk about, you know, her childhood or her mother or things that were troubled. And, you know, sometimes she would talk about how she didn't want to live anymore. She didn't want to be alive. And, you know, I remember when I was in college, you know, she went to a hospital, you know, and there was a suicide hotline and, you know, she was in the hospital and she had been drinking. And, you know, she was just, just really out of control. And I remember being really scared. I remember being really scared that, you know, she, she was going to do something that, you know, that would, you know, that would end her life. And, you know, that was really the first time I saw sort of how deeply troubled she was.</s> [INST] You know, it's so difficult because alcoholism is just so misunderstood. And I think one of the challenges is that there's a real stigma around it, right? Because when you think of alcoholism, you might think of someone who's like slumped over the bar, like a typical stereotype. But then you see someone who's very controlled and very precise and very orderly in their consumption of alcohol. And they're very careful not to get drunk. And they have this fear, as you described it, that if they weren't drinking, then they wouldn't be alive. There's this duality to it, which makes it difficult for people to understand. If they're not in control, then they're a problem drinker. If they're in control, then they're not. [/INST]Well, I think, you know, I think there's a lot of stigma around alcoholism. I think a lot of people don't understand it. I think that's part of the reason that I want to have tea with my mother is because, you know, I want to understand it. I want to understand her relationship to it. I want to understand how it manifests itself differently in different people. I want to understand, you know, the root causes of it. I want to understand, you know, why some people get sober and others don't. I want to understand, you know, a lot of things that I want to understand about it. And I think that's one of the things that I've struggled with is, you know, how do you deal with it? How do you talk about it? How do you sort of show up in a way that is, you know, respectful and, you know, that, you know, that acknowledges what the problem is, but also acknowledges that there is a solution, you know? And I think that's, I think that's what I'm really interested in is, you know, how do you, how do you, how do you talk about it? How do you, you know, how do you manage it? How do you deal with it?</s> [INST] I've never heard this before, but there's a term called kindling, which I found startling, where if you go to a bar and you have a drink and then you leave and you come back and have another drink, the alcoholic will get drunk much faster. So if you go in, have a drink, leave, come back, the person's not going to be able to have two drinks before they get completely drunk. So you can just imagine in a situation where someone who's struggling with alcoholism goes to a bar, has one drink, leaves, comes back, has two drinks, and then gets really drunk. And then they get the three, the four, the five, and they just don't remember what happened. [/INST]Well, I think, you know, part of it is, you know, if you're an alcoholic, you're different. I mean, there's just something about alcohol, even small amounts, will have a different effect on you. You know, I think, you know, if I drink, I drink a lot less than other people. But even if I drink one drink, you know, I'll feel it. I'll feel it the next day. I'll feel sort of, you know, I'll feel a little bit different because of it. And I think for an alcoholic, you know, even if you don't drink very much, there's something about the drink that changes you. And I think for a lot of alcoholics, you know, it's this sort of idea of normalcy. It's like, if I don't drink, I'm not going to be accepted. And if I do drink, and I don't drink very much, and people see that, then they're going to think that I'm an alcoholic. And that's part of the problem with alcoholism is that, you know, I think there's a lot of stigma around it, but there's also this kind of reality of well, if you don't drink, then you're not going to be accepted. And if you do drink, then there's this idea that you're going to be an alcoholic. And I think that's part of it.</s> [INST] When you were in your 20s, you described your relationship with alcohol as being very much like your mother's, very out of control. And then you said that there was a pivotal moment where you went to a party, got very drunk, and then the next day you had this sort of hangover. And then as you're describing it, you kind of started to avoid alcohol after that. Yeah. So alcohol was no longer your friend. [/INST]Well, I mean, I still drank. I just didn't drink as much. And I didn't drink the way that I used to. I didn't drink on nights where I had to get up early the next morning. I didn't drink when I had to be somewhere the next morning and I had to be sort of functional. I didn't drink when I wasn't having fun. I didn't drink when I wasn't in a social situation where I was supposed to be drinking. I didn't drink when I didn't want to. I didn't drink when I wanted to.</s> [INST] And did you have a conversation with her about alcoholism? [/INST]Well, I did, yeah. I did when I was in law school. I did when I was in college. We did when we were kids.</s> [INST] You did when you were kids? [/INST]Yeah. Yeah, I did when I was a kid. I do remember when I was probably 12. My mom got so drunk that, you know, she's laughing and she's crying and she's screaming and she's, you know, putting on a show like she's so drunk. And I remember my dad taking me aside and just telling me, you know, your mom's an alcoholic. This is what alcoholism is. And, you know, I remember at that time, I think we didn't really understand what was going on. We didn't really understand. I didn't really understand. I just knew that my mom was really troubled. I knew that she was just, she would do things that were really troubled. She would do things that were just, you know, she would be mean. She would be so silly. She would be so out of control. And, you know, I remember as I got older, I started to understand it a little bit more. I started to understand it more. And, you know, I think when I started drinking, I started to understand it more. And then I remember after law school, I started to really understand it more. And I remember when I was in my 20s, I started to understand it more.</s> [INST] What was the conversation like with your mother when you realized that you were alcoholic? [/INST]Well, I mean, we didn't really call it that. I mean, I think at that point we were just sort of really struggling with alcohol. I mean, I think alcoholics are people who have a lifelong obsession with this drink. And they use it unsuccessfully. And there's sort of like the DSM, the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, this sort of bible of psychiatric diagnosis, and it says that an alcoholic is someone who, and they may be sober, but they have this lifelong obsession with the drink. And if they start drinking, they're unable to drink normally. And that's what I knew. I knew that when I drank, I drank too much. I knew that I drank for the wrong reasons. I knew that when I drank, I became a different person. I knew that I didn't know when to stop. I didn't know when to stop. And I didn't know when to stop until I started going to AA.</s> [INST] When you start going to AA, how long ago was that? [/INST]Well, I started going to AA in law school.</s> [INST] Law school in the US, how long is law school? [/INST]It's three years.</s> [INST] So you started in the first year of your law school. [/INST]Yes, I did.</s> [INST] And then you were in law school for three years? [/INST]Yeah.</s> [INST] Then you went to Chicago, right? [/INST]Yeah.</s> [INST] And you've been living in Chicago ever since? [/INST]Yeah, I've lived in Chicago my whole law career, 28 years.</s> [INST] You went to law school in California and then came back to Chicago. [/INST]Yeah.</s> [INST] When you started to go to AA, you said that you realized you were alcoholic. [/INST]Well, I started to really understand it. I started to really understand it. I started to understand that this was not, this was not normal. This was not, you know, this was not something that, you know, normal people did. I started to understand that there was a disease. I started to understand that there was a disease. I started to understand that this was not, this was not normal. And, you know, I remember at law school, I remember the first meeting that I went to, you know, they say when you go to your first meeting, you're going to like 90% of the people because you're going to like them. You're going to like them because they're sober and because they're nice. And I remember the first meeting. I remember it. I remember it. And I remember just feeling, oh, I'm going to like this person. I'm going to like this person. I'm going to like them. And I remember feeling that. And I
<s><s> [INST] Jeremy, welcome to the Diary of a CEO. You've become a household name through your work on 'Top Gear' and 'The Grand Tour,' captivating audiences with your unique take on the world of motoring. But I'm interested in the journey that led you here. Can you take me back to your earliest years, to the moments and influences that steered you towards this path of becoming one of the most recognized figures in the world of automotive journalism? [/INST]I was brought up in a tiny village in Hampshire, and my earliest memories, I think like a lot of kids, was of my favorite happy memories being in the back of my dad's car, just driving around and watching the landscape go by, just talking and laughing with my family. And then when I was eight, we moved to another house, and we had to commute every Sunday, me and my brother, down to Hampshire to see our granny and grandad. And they had a 1977 Volkswagen Golf, which I just loved the look of. It had like a candy apple red metallic paint job. And that was my first sort of love of a car. And then when I was 14, I started driving the golf. And again, like a lot of kids, I wanted to change the exhaust and make it sound better. And then I started to get really into it. And I'd start washing it every Sunday before I drove it. And I started looking at it and going, this is a bit scuffed here. So I started sanding it down. I started getting it re-painted. And I started watching Top Gear for the first time. And I remember the host, the presenter, Richard Hammond. I thought, man, he's so cool. He's just talking about cars. He's like a kid. He's like me. You know, I'm 15, 16 at this point. And then I did my GCSEs and my A-levels and my AS-levels, whatever they were. And I got into university, but I just didn't like it. I didn't really know what I wanted to do. And then I got in touch with the people at Top Gear, the BBC, and I said, listen, I love cars, I watch your show, I'm 18 now, I want to come and work with you guys, like as an intern or whatever. And they said, well, we're shooting a show in South Africa called Road to Nowhere. We could use an extra driver. Would you be interested? And I went, yeah, sounds good. Like I'll give it a shot. And I went out there for a month. And I came back, and the BBC said, listen, we want to do another show. We want to do a spin-off. We want to do a show based on you. We want you to do a travelogue, but based on you. You know, you're obsessed with cars. We're going to follow you around South America for three months. We'll pay you. And you'll do all the research yourself. We'll just pay for the petrol and we'll film it. And I just said, yeah, let's do it. Like, I just, I didn't have a lot of money at the time and I just thought, you know, this is a chance to make a little bit of money and do something I love.</s> [INST] And from that, 'The Grand Tour' was born, right? [/INST]The Grand Tour was, well, The Grand Tour was a show we did for Amazon, so it was a completely different show. But The Chasm, the South American show, that was the first show.</s> [INST] Okay, so The Chasm, which then evolved into The Grand Tour. [/INST]Yeah.</s> [INST] Which is still going to this day, which is incredible. And you've been at the wheel of some of the most iconic cars, supercars, hypercars, and then you've driven them to places I could only ever dream of. If I could ask you to pick one car, just one car to take me on your journey with you, the car you've driven most, the car you've driven in your most memorable location, what would be that car and where would we go? [/INST]So the car I've driven most, I think it's probably, I'm going to say the Bugatti Veyron. We've driven the Veyron for three seasons. We've driven it in many different countries. It's just an incredible car. It's an incredible, to be able to go from 0 to 60 in 2.4 seconds, 2.3 seconds, it's an unbelievable experience. It's like being a child again. It's like when you first went on a fairground ride and you just felt the wind in your hair and you felt unstoppable. That's what that's like. And then if we're going to go to the location, if I'm going to choose one, I'd say the 1994 Jaguar XJR, 2.9 liters, 12 cylinders, 300 horsepower. We took it to Australia for a series we did called 'The Rarest Cars in the World.' And we drove it around the outback, and it's just the most incredible car. It's so comfortable. It's so refined. It's a car from 1994. It's a car that's over 25 years old. And I drove it around Australia and it was like, I just remember thinking, this car is so much better than all the supercars we have today. Like it's got character, it's got soul, it's got so much, it's so much more than just a number. You know, it's 200 horsepower, but it's got 190,000 miles on it. And I drove it through the outback, drove it through the outback for three days, drove it through Uluru, drove it through the Simpson Desert. And yeah, it's just an incredible car.</s> [INST] You know, it's so easy to get caught up in the, like, the flashy, the bright lights of the supercar. We think that they're the best because they go faster and they do 0 to 60 in like two seconds or whatever. But as you've journeyed through life and you've driven these incredible cars, the character, the soul, that you've described is something that we've lost in these modern cars because they're engineered for perfection. They're engineered for, you know, the fastest, safest, most efficient way of doing it. And that's why, you know, the classics are so special. They're special for so many reasons. One of them is that soul, that character, that feeling of being connected to the car. And it's funny, whenever I'm in a modern car, I always think, I don't feel connected to this thing. I don't really feel like I'm part of this thing. But when you're in one of those classic cars, it's almost like you are the thing. You are the car. You are the driver and the car. And it's just a real treat that I think people don't realize. [/INST]Yeah, I mean, like you said, I think there's something about a car that's 20, 30 years old. It's got a story, you know, it's been through life, it's had other people driving it, it's had other experiences. And when you drive it, you feel like you're part of something, you know, it's a story. And you've got to remember as well, these cars are so much cheaper. And if you're a young person, if you're someone who loves cars, but can't afford the 10 million pound Bugatti, you can buy these cars for a couple of grand. You can go and buy a classic car for a couple of grand. And that's a way to get into the game. You can go and look at them. You can go and learn about them. You can go and read books about them. You can go and watch YouTube videos. And then you can go and buy something that's 20 years old and then you can learn. And that's what we love about cars. And that's why I love the fact that we're going back to a time before we had the world at our fingertips. You had to go and research a car. You had to read about it. You had to learn about it. And that's the beauty of these cars.</s> [INST] Jeremy, thank you. Thank you for your time. Thank you for the inspiration. And thank you for the fact that you've spent your life doing things that I love to watch. So it's a duty that you've served to the world that I think I'm going to be eternally grateful for. So thank you. Thank you so much. It means a lot to me. [/INST]Thank you. I appreciate it.</s> [INST] It's funny, every year around this time of year, I think my mind goes a little bit darker, shall I say. And I think that's quite appropriate, because this is the time of year where my life is most out of balance. So it's funny that that's a themed-up podcast. Right now, I'm in a really interesting period in my life. And I'm very much enjoying it. It's a little bit of a juggling act, I think, as I said to you earlier, but I'm very much enjoying it. And I'm learning a lot. And I think that's the most important thing. I think if I wasn't learning and I didn't love what I'm doing now, then I don't know what I would do. And I don't think I'd be as happy as I am now. And I think that's incredibly important. I think we all need to find our way to that point where we're doing something we love, but it's also work. And I think that's the sweet spot that I'm currently in. And that's why I'm so excited to be here and to be involved in so many things that I love. And also to be working with such brilliant people who are so talented. And also to be running and working in a business that's going so well and seems to be expanding ever so quickly. It's very exciting. And I love it. I love the challenge. I love the creativity. And I love the fact that every day is a brand new day. I never know what I'm going to be, you know, it could be an adverse story or it could be a happy story or whatever it might be. But it's a real privilege to do it and a real pleasure. Thank you. Thank you. What a pleasure. [/INST]</s> [INST] Over the last few years, I've realised that my first foundation is my health, something you've heard me talk about a lot. Nothing matters more than that first foundation. So that's why I'm so excited to be involved with a company like Whoop, who are leading the charge when it comes to bettering your health. All my friends have received Whoops from me, as has my mum. My sister has two sets of Whoops, one for work, one for when she's training. And what I really like about Whoop is that it's very personalized. It's empirical. It's sort of data-driven. And it makes recommendations for sleep, for recovery, for how you can perform at your highest. And my experience has been in my own life, it can really make a big difference. So I'm so excited to be involved with such a fantastic brand. And if you're listening to the podcast and you want to get a Whoop of your very own, use the code, it's CEO10 for 10% off and let me know how you get on when it arrives. You got to the end of this podcast. Whenever someone gets to the end of this podcast, I feel like I owe them a greater debt of gratitude because that means you sat through the whole thing. And hopefully that suggests that you enjoyed it. If you are at the end and you enjoyed this podcast, could you do me a little bit of a favor and hit that subscribe button?
